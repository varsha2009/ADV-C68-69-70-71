                    <p class="text-muted text-left">Every school has a library and like every school, even my school has a wonderful library. A library is a very important part of a school as it helps students to gain and acquire knowledge.


                        It is the heart and soul of a school as it provides lots of information and details that students would require.


                        Our school has a very large library. There are plenty number of books in the library. We have a librarian who keeps a track of all the books that go in and out of the library. We have an exclusive library period, where we are allowed to go and read books.


                        From small story books to large reference books, journals and magazines are all available in our library. They are all arranged in different sections, so that it becomes easy for those who search for a particular book. It helps students refer notes that they are looking for and helps in cultivating a reading habit too.


                        The librarian allocates cards to students and notes down details when a book is being lend from the library. Once the reference is over, then the book needs to be returned back to the library. We children usually read small story books or Children`s Knowledge bank book, but we have seen students from higher classes, visit library and note down points that they require for their learning. They sometimes even take books from library for reference.


                        The library is usually a very quiet place and it is often seen full with students and teachers refereeing notes that they require for the respective subjects that they are looking out for. There is a separate reading room in the library where students could go and read whatever they like, but maintain silence.


                        Lots of knowledge could be acquired from a library and our school library has a great collection of books, which makes this a lot easier for students to gather information.I like my library very much and I love spending time reading books, sitting in the reading room. It is so quiet that one could really enjoy reading and also study peacefully and learn a lot of great things in the world.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted text-left">In the context of formal education, art and craft must be given utmost importance. As an individual subject, it holds and supports the personal, social, moral, spiritual, and creative development of a child. It helps the child to participate and explore the visual and tactile experience. It further helps the child to recognize and communicate the unlimited and variant ideas and meanings. These are the opportunities that a child gets to work on them and find a way to develop confidence, a sense of competence, vivid imagination and bloom with creativity.

                        Art and craft club in the school is important to enrich young children’s experience, motivating, and helping them to develop positive attitude to the school and life, beyond the formal education. Being part of the club, it will help the child understand the meaning of his imagination and learn to self-express his vision. It will enhance child’s individual’s craftsmanship, giving them an exposure to various types of craft and art. This way they learn about where does their interest lies. This also strengthens them in academics as it becomes more interesting and they are able to comprehend what they are learning. With all this, they love a life skill which is an addition on to what they will achieve in life outside their comfort level.</p>

">The New Education Policy expands age group 6-14 years of mandatory schooling to 3-18 years of schooling. The NEP introduces hitherto uncovered three years of pre-schooling, age group of 3-6 years under the school curriculum. The new system will have 12 years of schooling with three years of Anganwadi/ pre-schooling.With an emphasis on Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), the 10+2 structure of school curriculum is to be replaced by a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to ages 3-8, 8-11, 11-14, and 14-18 years respectively.
